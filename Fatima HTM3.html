                cratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool for programming, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[6] Users on the site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Projects can be exported to HTML5, JavaScript, Android apps and EXE files using external tools. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.[7] Scratch is taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions.
